  <h2>About This Course</h2>
  <p>A single chip sized of few millimeters may have Millions of transistors in it for example a microprocessor is a VLSI device. Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) is the process of creating integrated circuits by combining large numbers of transistors into a single chip.</p>

  <p>This lab provides good understanding and learning opportunity of VLSI designing for users. There are ten experiments in this lab, </p>
